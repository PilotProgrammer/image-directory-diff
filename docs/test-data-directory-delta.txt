delta directories A/B
in A but not in B
* a/1.mov
* a/1.png

in B but not in A
* NOTHING (both files are in A)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
delta directories B/C
in B but not in C (files are same content, but names are different, so should still show up in "delta")
* b/2.mov
* b/2.png

in C but not in B (follows same logic as "in B but not in C")
* c/1.mov
* c/1.png
