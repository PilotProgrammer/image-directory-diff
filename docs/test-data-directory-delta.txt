in A but not in B
* 1.mov

in B but not in A
* NOTHING (both files are in A)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
delta directories B/C
in B but not in C (files are same content, but names are different, so should still show up in "delta")
* 2.mov

in C but not in B (follows same logic as "in B but not in C")
